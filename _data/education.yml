    During my time at CSU I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and leadership skills as well as being adaptable to learn most anything. I thouroughly enjoyed my time at university taking on different challenges I set up for myself.

    I spent a lot of my free time as the President of Board Games CLub of CSU and Vice President of the Electrial Engineering Club
