      <p class="lead">
        In 2017 I traveled with some friends from University to compete in the Cyber Cup. Sadly my teamate could not make it so
        I had to go it alone. On the first day we had to do prelims which were Jepordy style questions regarding topics in Cyber Security.
        The real challenge was the final round where we are in an Attack/Defend sitution. Against the odds I came out in First place winning
        $6,000 and valuable expirence.

      <p class="lead">
        In 2017 I got the opportunity to Mentor in the Google IgniteCS Program where I actually went to my High School with my colleague Matt Bowen.
        IgniteCS is a 5 week program aimed at teaching kids the importance of computer science. Our group of students even got a taste of more advanced
        topics in Web Attacks, Cryptography, Programming, and Kali Linux. Overall it was a great learning expirence for everyone.
